# Insight and Findings
Some mid-range cars deliver speed and acceleration close to premium models, showing that higher cost does not always equal higher performance.
Certain compact engines achieve higher horsepower-per-liter efficiency compared to larger engines.

Fuel Type Comparison:
Electric cars excel in acceleration but may have limited top speed.
Gasoline cars dominate in top speed but are less efficient in fuel-to-power ratio.
Hybrid cars provide balance but often at higher costs.

A few luxury models stand out with extreme horsepower-to-capacity ratios, setting new benchmarks.
Some models score high across speed, acceleration, horsepower, and price, making them the most balanced choices.

# AI Support Explanation
The implementation of the IBM Granite Instruct Model played a pivotal role in this project by enabling automated classification and analysis of the 2025 Cars Dataset. Through advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the model was able to:
Process complex dataset attributes (e.g., top speed, acceleration, engine size, and price) and map them into structured categories.
Ensure consistency and accuracy in applying predefined classification rules across all entries.
Generate comprehensive summaries and tables, highlighting key distribution patterns across performance, engine size, pricing, and fuel type.
Support decision-making by extracting meaningful insights that may not be easily visible through raw data inspection.
